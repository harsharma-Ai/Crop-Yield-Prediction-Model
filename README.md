# 🌾 Crop Yield Predictor

A machine learning-based web application that predicts crop yield using key weather parameters like rainfall, temperature, and humidity. This project combines data analysis, machine learning, and a web interface to provide real-time predictions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Agriculture is highly dependent on environmental conditions. This project helps in estimating crop yield based on historical weather data, allowing better planning and decision-making.

The model is trained using real datasets and deployed through a Flask web application where users can input weather conditions and get predictions instantly.
